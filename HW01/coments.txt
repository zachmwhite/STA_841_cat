1. -2. You should describe your methods and results. You present all your code and output. I need to check all your code to figure out what you intended to do. -1. Your graph is not informative. One may want to show that the observed data is against the null hypothesis. You only plot the posteriors under different priors but did not compare them with the null. 2. (a) -1. You plot x^2 but not x^(20) (c) -1.5. This is a two-sided test and the p-value should be 2 times the p-value you reported. The method for calculating CI is wrong. When compute CI by inverting a test, you cannot assume a true value of the parameter. Check section 1.4.2 in the textbook or sample solution. (d) -0.5. Your final CI is correct but your derivation is not correct. It may not be a symmetric interval. Check section 1.4.2 in the textbook or sample solution. 5. -8. I did not see why using 1/RR is reasonable. If you think it is reasonable, you need to explain why it is reasonable. 6. (a) -2. You should describe the nature of the change. (b) -2. You need to comment on the appropriateness of scores. 8. mantelhaen.test() can be used for CMH test. 9. -3. Your explanation for odds ratio and CI is wrong. According to your formulation of data. Your odds ratio is actually the odds for getting heel pain before study is 0.333 as that after study. Therefore, a conclusion may be the new shoes may cause heel pain.
